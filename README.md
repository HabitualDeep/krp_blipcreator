## Description

## Features
- Create new blips with custom names, types, colors, and positions.
- View existing blips with options to enable/disable and delete them.
- User-friendly graphical interface for blip management.
- Integrated with ESX for permission-based access control.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including `mysql-async` and `es_extended`.
2. Download the Blip Creator resource and add it to your FiveM server's `resources` directory.
3. Add `start blipcreator` to your server.cfg file to ensure the resource is started when your server starts.
4. Restart your FiveM server to apply the changes.

## Usage
